        The IHS Dev Team is a club at Ithaca High School dedicated to learning programming and expanding our knowledge
        through competitions and project development. In-club, we collaborate on projects, discuss topics and make decisions
        on upcoming or current events and activities, but the majority of our efforts are directed towards preparing for
        programming competitions such as the PClassic, St. Bonaventure and ACSL contests. 
        <br><br> This website was created to practice Javascript, CSS and website programming.
        <br><br> Interested in joining? No experience is required and all are welcome! We meet in Room H-211 on Thursdays, and
        information, coding help and snacks are available.
